# Reset-Your-password

This code was written to simulate the process you go through when you forgot your password and are trying to reset it.

The first part verifies your identity (to check if the person trying to change the password is the owner of the account). The user can choose to do this by receiving a text message with a security code (scenario 1). The user can also choose to answer the security questions (scenario 2). 

If the user's identity is verified, the user is then asked to enter a new password twice.

NOTE: The program is made for a fictional
Since the person trying to reset his/her password usually already has a security profile (i.e. security questions and answers have been pre-determined), this program is written to simulate that. This means the program will only run completely if the right answers are entered (provided in the next comment; you can either ignore the answers or part of the answers and see what happens if you enter the wrong input or you can enter the answers below and see what happens if the program runs succesfully).
